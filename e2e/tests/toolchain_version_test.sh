# The sha256 pin already guarantees the bytes. What it does not guarantee is that the
# archive was unpacked with the right strip_prefix, that bin/julia came out executable,
# or that the rest of the distribution came with it: Julia finds its bundled stdlib
# relative to Sys.BINDIR, so a toolchain reduced to the binary alone starts and then
# fails on the first `using`. Asking Julia to load a stdlib proves the whole tree.
