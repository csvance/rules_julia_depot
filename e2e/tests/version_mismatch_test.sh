# This is the guarantee the whole module is built around, and it is the one failure that
# is invisible if it does not fire: a Manifest resolved under another Julia instantiates
# happily and then behaves differently at run time. So the test runs the script directly,
# with a real Julia and a real Manifest that disagree, and insists on three things: a
# non-zero exit, the message that names both versions, and no stamp file, since a stamp
# is the module's claim that an environment is good.
