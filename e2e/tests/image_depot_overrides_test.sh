# Artifact overrides: the substitution works, and a broken one is caught rather than
# shipped.
#
# An override swaps a locally built native library in for the registry one. It takes two
# files because the path differs between build and image, and the dangerous outcome is
# not a hard failure: if Pkg downloads the registry artifact anyway, the image carries
# BOTH copies and loads the wrong one, silently. So each case is driven end to end.
#
#   correct   the build-time override points at a directory that exists, Pkg skips the
#             download, the hash is absent from the layer, and the IMAGE Overrides.toml
#             is what ships (naming the in-image path, not this machine's)
#   broken    the override points at a directory that does not exist, Pkg downloads the
#             artifact, and the script fails instead of producing that image
#   quoted    the same broken case with the hash written as a quoted TOML key, which is
#             equally valid TOML and must not slip past the check
#
# It also covers the guard on the pair itself: a build-time override with no image-time
# one would ship this host's paths, and is refused before any work happens.
#
# The artifact hash is not hard-coded. It is measured with the module's own
# artifact_paths.jl, which is what a consumer writing an override has to do anyway.
