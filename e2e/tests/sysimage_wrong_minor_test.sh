#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sysimage.sh refuses a PackageCompiler environment resolved under another Julia minor.
#
# PackageCompiler's compat bounds and its precompile cache are both keyed on the Julia
# minor, so an environment pinned for one minor and used under another fails deep inside
# PackageCompiler, minutes into a build, with a message about something else. The script
# checks the pin up front instead. This drives the explicit-project branch, where the
# consumer named the environment rather than saying `auto`, which is the case where
# getting it wrong is possible at all.
