# sysimage.sh `auto` picks the PackageCompiler environment for the running Julia, and
# the sysimage it builds actually loads.
#
# `auto` is what makes the module's sysimage support version-agnostic: the consumer's
# genrule names no version, and the script selects julia/sysimage/v<major>.<minor>/ from
# the Julia that is running. Selecting the WRONG one is not a silent failure, because
# the script then compares that environment's julia_version against the running Julia
# and exits, which is exactly what sysimage_wrong_minor_test.sh checks. So a clean
# build here proves the selection was right, and the two tests together cover both
# branches.
#
# Building is not enough on its own. A sysimage that compiles and then cannot be loaded
# is the failure that costs a deployment, so the image is started and asked to use the
# package that was baked into it.
