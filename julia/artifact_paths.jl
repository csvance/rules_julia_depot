# MEASUREMENT TOOL. Do NOT use this to define an image's artifact layer.
#
# Prints one absolute artifact directory per line for the packages in the active
# manifest, by walking each package's Artifacts.toml.
#
# It is tempting to assume a static walk is a safe superset of what a process loads at
# runtime. That is false, and it was measured to be false, which is why the warning
# above exists (one server, 210-package manifest):
#
#   static walk, HostPlatform()      17 directories
#   actually resolved at runtime      19 (18 artifacts + the Julia install dir)
#
# The gap is HDF5_jll. It ships `.pkg/platform_augmentation.jl` and tags its artifact
# entries with `mpi`, so selection needs a platform *augmented* by the package's own
# code. A plain HostPlatform() carries no `mpi` tag, matches nothing, and the artifact
# is dropped with no error. Any package may do this, so no fixed platform makes the
# walk trustworthy.
#
# The other difference is benign: the stdlib JLLs (OpenBLAS, LibCURL, Zlib and ten
# more) resolve into the Julia installation directory rather than the depot, because
# they ship inside the Julia distribution. The base image provides those, so they are
# not layer content.
#
# THE CORRECT WAY TO BUILD THE LAYER is to instantiate the Manifest into a dedicated
# empty depot and take that depot's artifacts/ wholesale. Pkg performs the augmented
# platform selection itself, so the result is complete and minimal by construction,
# with no enumeration heuristic to be wrong. A developer depot is large only because it
# accumulates every project on the machine; a Manifest-scoped depot holds one project's.
#
# What this script is still good for: measuring the expected size, and cross-checking a
# built layer against the manifest to catch a depot that was never fully instantiated
# (it reports hashes it could not resolve to a present directory).
