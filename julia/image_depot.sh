# Build the depot layer for a container image from a Manifest-pinned project.
#
# Usage: image_depot.sh <project dir> <output tar>
#
# Environment:
#   JULIA_BIN                     required, the julia to instantiate with
#   JULIA_DEPOT_PATH              required, the SOURCE depot: its registries/ and servers/
#                                 (package-server credentials) are copied into the clean
#                                 depot so instantiate resolves the way the developer does
#   JULIA_PKG_SERVER              optional, passed through to Pkg (default: Pkg's default)
#   JULIA_DEPOT_CONTENTS          artifacts (default) | full, see below
#   JULIA_DEPOT_IMAGE_PREFIX      path of the depot inside the image, default opt/julia-depot
#   JULIA_DEPOT_MIN_ARTIFACTS     sanity floor on artifact directories, default 1
#   JULIA_DEPOT_OVERRIDES_BUILD   optional artifacts/Overrides.toml for the build (see below)
#   JULIA_DEPOT_OVERRIDES_IMAGE   optional artifacts/Overrides.toml to ship in the image
#
# WHY A SECOND DEPOT. depot.bzl conforms the developer's ambient depot to the Manifest,
# which is right for building fast on a workstation and wrong for an image: that tree
# holds every project on the machine, of which this one needs a sliver. So the image gets
# its own depot, instantiated from the Manifest into an empty directory.
#
# WHY NOT ENUMERATE THE ARTIFACTS INSTEAD. Because it silently under-counts. A static walk
# of every Artifacts.toml with HostPlatform() misses packages that augment the platform
# with their own code (HDF5_jll ships .pkg/platform_augmentation.jl and tags its entries
# with `mpi`); a plain HostPlatform() matches nothing, drops the artifact with no error,
# and the failure lands in production as a missing native library at first use. Letting
# Pkg instantiate means Pkg performs the augmented selection, so the set is complete and
# minimal by construction. See artifact_paths.jl, which exists to measure, not to decide.
#
# WHY A SYSIMAGE DOES NOT MAKE THIS REDUNDANT. A sysimage carries compiled code, not
# native libraries. JLLWrappers resolves artifact directories in __init__, at startup,
# which is also why the artifacts can live at a different path in the image than they did
# at build time. Pointed at an empty depot, startup dies in the first JLL's __init__.
#
# NO PRECOMPILATION, in either mode. Julia's compile cache is keyed on the absolute paths
# the code was loaded from, so a cache built against this temporary depot is invalid the
# moment the layer is unpacked at the image prefix. A full-mode image therefore pays its
# precompilation once at first start; a sysimage is the real fix.
#
# ARTIFACT OVERRIDES substitute a locally built artifact for a registry one. Two files,
# because the path differs between build and image: the build-time file names a directory
# on this host and is consulted by Pkg.instantiate, which skips downloading any artifact
# whose HASH is overridden to an existing directory (only hash-keyed overrides have that
# effect; UUID/name overrides are honoured at load time, not at download time); the image
# file names the in-image path and is what ships. The build fails if an overridden hash
# was downloaded anyway, since the image would then carry both and load the registry one.
