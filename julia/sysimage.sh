# Build a sysimage for a Manifest-pinned project with PackageCompiler.
#
# Usage: JULIA_SYSIMAGE_PACKAGES="Pkg1 Pkg2" sysimage.sh <project dir> <build project> <out.so>
#
#   <project dir>    the project whose packages are baked (a COPY; see below)
#   <build project>  the PackageCompiler environment, or `auto` to use the one shipped
#                    beside this script for the running Julia's minor version
#                    (sysimage/v1.12, sysimage/v1.13, ...). Under Bazel, `auto` needs
#                    @rules_julia_depot//julia:sysimage_envs among the action's srcs.
#   <out.so>         sysimage path to write
#
# Environment:
#   JULIA_BIN                    the julia to use (falls back to PATH for hand runs)
#   JULIA_SYSIMAGE_PACKAGES      required, space-separated package names to bake
#   JULIA_SYSIMAGE_CPU_TARGET    default "generic", so the image runs on any x86_64 host
#
# WHAT IT COSTS. Code baked into a sysimage cannot be revised. Use the sysimage when the
# baked packages are fixed underneath you, and an ordinary Revise loop when they are not.
#
# WHAT IS NOT IN IT. No precompile trace: `create_sysimage` alone bakes the module code
# and type system, which is the bulk of load time. Method specialisations from a
# --trace-compile run are a further win and need a representative workload.
#
# PASS A COPY of the project directory when running under Bazel: srcs are staged as
# symlinks to the real files, so anything that wrote to the project would corrupt the
# actual Manifest.toml.
